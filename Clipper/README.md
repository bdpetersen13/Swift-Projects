Your clipboard often contains sensitive passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data. If your device is compromised, hackers or other malicious actors can easily access this information. In addition, app companies have been seen copying the clipboard data of their users. By regularly deleting your clipboard, you can help to protect your personal information and maintain your privacy.
## Getting Started
