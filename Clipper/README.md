# Clipper!

This single-view application is a minimal and lightweight application that allows users to press a single button to erase anything saved in their clipboard.


# Motivation

This single-view application is a minimal and lightweight application that allows users to press a single button to erase anything saved in their clipboard. Your clipboard often contains sensitive passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data. If your device is compromised, hackers or other malicious actors can easily access this information. In addition, app companies have been seen copying the clipboard data of their users. By regularly deleting your clipboard, you can help to protect your personal information and maintain your privacy.
## Getting Started

Currently, this application does not meet the App Store guidelines for publications. Furthermore, since this app's primary purpose is to clear the clipboard can be seen by Apple as having limited functionality and lacking a clear purpose.

Therefore, to get started, you must clone this repository to your chosen place on your local device.

Once you have the project saved on your local device, upload the project to your IDE of choice for iOS development. Next will be to build and run the application.



## Usage

When opening the application, the user is greeted with a single-view application with a button labeled "Erase Clipboard" directly in the center of the screen. The background of the application is based on the user's default "Light" or "Dark" appearance.

When the user presses the button, a pop-up notification informs the user their clipboard has been erased. In addition, above the button, a text label appears stating "Clipboard Erased!"
