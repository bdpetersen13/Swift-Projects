# Simple Calculator

Math can be challenging and tedious at times. That's where Simple Calculator comes in. As the name implies, the simple Calculator is a basic calculator application. Simple Calculator boasts a big clear display with large buttons that make it quick and easy to perform calculations. 
Simple Calculator allows the application to be used in both portrait and landscape while retaining the basic functionality and easy user interface for quick calculations. 
The Simple Calculator application allows for quick and easy operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, finding the percentage, and changing a value's positive/negative sign.



## Motivation

The purpose of building this application is to test my Swift knowledge as I begin my Swift/iOS programming journey. As I learn Swift, I will be creating a foundation for learning as I learn new concepts and ideas. 

The goal for this application is as follows: 

•	Create a fully functional application that allows for simple calculations.

•	Properly implement constraints, containers, subviews, and stack views that allow for auto layout and auto orientation of a wide variety of devices.



## Getting Started

To get started, you will first need to clone this repository to a place of your choosing on your local device.

Once you have the project saved on your local device, upload the project to your IDE of choice for iOS development. Next will be to build and run the application.
    
## Usage

Using the application is straightforward. 

First, opening the application presents the user with the application's main view, the Numpad. The Numpad is where all the calculations will be happening. The user will need to enter the first value for their desired calculation. 

Next, they will need to select the desired operator for the calculation they would like to perform. 

Third, they will need to enter their second value. 

Lastly, they will need to hit the equal button to get the result of their desired calculation.

Below are images of the application:

## Roadmap

There is still much to be done with this project, and it's far from completion. The following steps of the project I intend to implement are as follows:

1.	Add history view to see recent calculations since the launch of the application

2. Add audible click sound when user interacts with the UIButtons
