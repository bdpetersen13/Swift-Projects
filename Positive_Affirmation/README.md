# Positive Affrmation

Times are tough, and it can be hard to find the motivation to remain positive during these difficult times. Positive affirmations are quotes and phrases used to challenge negative and unhelpful thoughts. 

The Positive Affirmation application, as the name implies, is an application that provides a positive affirmation to the users of the application. Each time the application is loaded, the user is presented with a random positive affirmation image selected from an array. The UI for this application is minimal and is only the positive affirmation image and a single button that sets a random image from the array when interacted with by the user.

## Motivation

The purpose of building this application is to test my Swift knowledge as I begin my Swift/iOS programming journey. As I learn Swift, I will be creating a foundation for learning as I learn new concepts and ideas. 

The goal for this application is as follows: 

•	Create a fully functional application that cycles through multiple images when a UI button is pressed. 

•	Create a variable that stores an array of images.

•	Use randomization to randomize the images chosen when the user interacts with the UI button.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will first need to clone this repository to a place of your choosing on your local device.

Once you have the project saved on your local device, upload the project to your IDE of choice for iOS development. Next will be to build and run the application.
    
## Usage

Using the application is straight forward and easy. First, opening the application presents the user with a positive affirmation image. Then, if the user wishes to receive more positive affirmations, they can select the random button at the bottom of the screen and get a new positive affirmation message.

Below are images of the application:

## Roadmap

There is still much to be done with this project, and it's far from completion. The following steps of the project I intend to implement are as follows:

1.	Add more images to the array to select from.

2.	Create functionality that will allow users to select and favorite specific images.

3.  Create a side menuato allow users to select the favorites tab for viewing their selected favorite images.
