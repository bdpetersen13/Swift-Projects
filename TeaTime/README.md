# Tea Time!

The Tea Time application is minimal and lightweight, allowing you to track the time it takes to steep your tea accurately.

Tea Time allows you to steep the perfect cup of tea without inconveniencing you.


## Motivation

Tea is a delicious drink! It has quickly become one of my favorite drinks in recent years! It's something I am becoming obsessed with. There are numerous benefits to drinking tea beside the variety of flavors. These benefits include, but are not limited to, many antioxidants, reduce pain and muscle spasms, help you relax and reduce stress, improve blood pressure and blood circulation, relieve headaches and migraines, etc.

The Tea Time app makes it easy to keep track of your steep time. In addition, the Tea Time app allows you to continue working on your important tasks while your tea steps and will notify you with a cheerful alarm when your steeping time is done.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will first need to clone this repository to a place of your choosing on your local device.

Once you have the project saved on your local device, upload the project to your IDE of choice for iOS development. Next will be to build and run the application.
    
## Usage

First, opening the application presents the user with the application's main view, the timer. The primary view is where everything happens. There are six varieties of tea to choose from; black, green, matcha, herbal, white, and oolong. The user will begin the application by selecting and tapping on which tea they would like to brew.

Next, the countdown timer will begin. The text view at the top of the page will indicate which tea the user has selected, and the progress bar will start to increment with each passing second.

Once the allotted time for the selected tea is up, the progress bar will be complete, and a cheerful chime will play to indicate to the user the brewing process is complete.

## Roadmap

There is still much to be done with this project, and it's far from completion. The following steps of the project I intend to implement are as follows:
1.	Change the current six teas into categories

2.	Within each of the categories, add various teas and their steeping times

3.	Allow the user to modify the brewing process for their specific needs

4.	Create brewing animation while the time is counting down
